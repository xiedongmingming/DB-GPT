# Plugins

The ability of Agent and Plugin is the core of whether large models can be automated. In this project, we natively support the plugin mode, and large models can automatically achieve their goals. At the same time, in order to give full play to the advantages of the community, the plugins used in this project natively support the Auto-GPT plugin ecology, that is, Auto-GPT plugins can directly run in our project.
